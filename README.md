## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where Cassandra types a poem that accidentally predicts a minor, surreal event in the next 24 hours.
- Create a monologue from the perspective of Mira Green, explaining why she took the ledger and what she believes it truly contains.
- Describe a new character Leo and Cassandra meet in a late-night diner: a bus driver who speaks only in cryptic, cut-up newspaper headlines.
- Imagine a chapter from the point of view of Leo's father, as he waits in the hotel suite, focusing on the textures and smells he uses to armor himself against his son's world.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a web-based 'collage machine' where users can layer text from the novel, Beat poetry, and financial news headlines to generate new surreal prose.
- Create a text analyzer that identifies and visualizes the 'gender dynamics' of dialogue in the novel, mapping who speaks, interrupts, describes, or is described.
